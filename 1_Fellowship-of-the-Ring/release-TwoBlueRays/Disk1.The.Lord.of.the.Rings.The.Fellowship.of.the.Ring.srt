14
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:49,269
I smell it in the air.

15
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,476
Much that once was...

16
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:53,276
...is lost.

17
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:56,976
For none now live who remember it.

18
00:00:56,976 --> 00:01:04,477
The Lord of the Rings.

19
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:14,177
It began with the forging of the great rings.

20
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,201
Three were given to the elves:

21
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:19,982
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

22
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,782
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

23
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:27,649
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,440
And nine...

25
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:33,408
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

26
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:37,508
...who, above all else, desire power.

27
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:43,708
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

28
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:48,508
But they were all of them deceived.

29
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,908
For another ring was made.

30
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:55,209
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

31
00:01:55,809 --> 00:02:00,109
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

32
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,409
... to control all others.

33
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,509
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

34
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,909
...and his will to dominate all life.

35
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:15,809
One ring to rule them all.

36
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:18,410
One by one...

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,110
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,410
But there were some who resisted.

39
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,510
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

40
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,410
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

52
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,612
...could not be undone.

56
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:44,713
It was in this moment...

57
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,313
... when all hope had faded...

58
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:51,513
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

59
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:29,015
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

60
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,315
The ring passed to Isildur...

61
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,615
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

62
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,515
But the hearts of men...

63
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:48,215
...are easily corrupted.

64
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:53,016
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

65
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,917
It betrayed Isildur...

66
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,217
... to his death.

67
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:33,217
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

68
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:35,717
...were lost.

69
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:38,817
History became legend...

70
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:41,017
...legend became myth.

71
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:44,018
And for two and a half thousand years...

72
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,018
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

73
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:51,418
Until, when chance came...

74
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,218
...it ensnared a new bearer.

75
00:05:56,718 --> 00:06:01,318
My precious.

76
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:04,218
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

77
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:08,218
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

78
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,519
And there it consumed him.

79
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,719
It came to me.

80
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:18,319
My own. My love. My own.

81
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:23,219
My precious.

82
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,319
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

83
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:34,319
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

84
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:39,020
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

85
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

86
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,720
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

87
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,720
... whispers of a nameless fear.

88
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,220
And the ring of power perceived...

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,220
...its time had now come.

90
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,320
It abandoned Gollum.

91
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:05,321
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

92
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:10,821
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

93
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,221
What's this?

94
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,921
A hobbit.

95
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,721
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

96
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,821
A ring.

97
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,821
Lost!

98
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,922
My precious is lost!

99
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,522
For the time will soon come...

100
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:34,822
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

101
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:41,597
The 22nd day of September...

102
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:45,722
...in the year 1400...

103
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:48,322
...by Shire-reckoning.

104
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:54,523
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

105
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,823
...the Shire...

106
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,823
...Middle-earth.

107
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,723
The third age of this world.

108
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:15,123
The Fellowship of the Ring.

109
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,024
There and back again.

110
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,724
A Hobbit's tale.

111
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:29,824
By Bilbo Baggins.

112
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,324
Now...

113
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,124
...where to begin?

114
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:41,524
Ah, yes....

115
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,825
"Concerning...

116
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,525
...Hobbits."

117
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:55,125
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

118
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,425
...for many hundreds of years...

119
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:00,725
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

120
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,825
...by the world of the big folk.

121
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:09,726
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

122
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:13,226
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

123
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:17,326
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

124
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:21,726
...nor counted among the very wise.

125
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:29,126
Frodo! Someone at the door.

126
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,926
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

127
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:37,427
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

128
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,127
A rather unfair observation...

129
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:43,827
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

130
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:47,127
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

131
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,427
But where our hearts truly lie...

132
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,727
...is in peace and quiet...

133
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,627
...and good, tilled earth.

134
00:09:55,927 --> 00:10:00,928
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

135
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,428
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

136
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:13,828
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

137
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:20,328
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

138
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,829
Frodo, the door!

139
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,629
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

140
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,529
Frodo!

141
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,729
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

142
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:53,330
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

143
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,530
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

144
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,030
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

145
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,230
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

146
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,730
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

147
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,831
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

148
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:24,231
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

149
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,631
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

150
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:46,232
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

151
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,132
How is the old rascal?

152
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:54,232
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

153
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:56,832
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

154
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:59,032
Well, that should please him.

155
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,032
Half the Shire's been invited.

156
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,932
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

157
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,333
And so life in the Shire goes on...

158
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,633
... very much as it has this past age.

159
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:19,233
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

160
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,433
If it comes at all.

161
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,133
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

162
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,733
...passing from one generation to the next.

163
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:35,134
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

164
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:36,834
...in Bag End.

165
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,334
And there always will be.

166
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:46,334
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

167
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,934
I mean, more than usual.

168
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,834
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

169
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,534
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

170
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:13,035
Where's it gone?

171
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,836
He's up to something.

172
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,437
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

173
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:54,337
But I know you have something to do with it.

174
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:55,737
Good gracious me.

175
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,837
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

176
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:00,037
Indeed.

177
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,537
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

178
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:08,837
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

179
00:14:09,237 --> 00:14:12,737
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

180
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:17,037
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

181
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,438
Oh, really?

182
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:27,038
Gandalf! Gandalf!

183
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,438
Fireworks, Gandalf!

184
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:40,038
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

185
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,039
Gandalf?

186
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,539
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

187
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,940
So am I.

188
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,241
No, thank you!

189
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:48,141
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

190
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:51,941
And what about very old friends?

191
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,941
Gandalf?

192
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:00,942
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

193
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:06,242
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

194
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,142
You haven't aged a day.

195
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,742
Come on, come in!

196
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,342
Welcome, welcome.

197
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:25,042
Oh, here we are.

198
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:29,243
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

199
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:33,143
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

200
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:37,243
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

201
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:42,943
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

202
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:45,843
Just tea, thank you.

203
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,944
I was expecting you sometime last week.

204
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:57,444
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

205
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:02,744
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

206
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:06,344
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

207
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:10,544
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

208
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,244
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

209
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:18,245
I've just found some sponge cake.

210
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:22,545
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

211
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,045
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

212
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:32,345
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

213
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,445
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

214
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,245
I'm not at home!

215
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,846
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

216
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,146
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

217
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,246
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

218
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:54,246
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

219
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:56,346
...never giving me a moment's peace.

220
00:17:57,246 --> 00:18:00,646
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

221
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:05,346
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

222
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:09,447
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

223
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,947
All the arrangements are made.

224
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,547
Oh, thank you.

225
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,347
Frodo suspects something.

226
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,047
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

227
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,847
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

228
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,247
You will tell him, won't you?

229
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:30,147
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

230
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,947
I know.

231
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,648
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

232
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,548
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

233
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,548
The woods, the fields.

234
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,048
Little rivers.

235
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:57,248
I am old, Gandalf.

236
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:03,749
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

237
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:08,649
I feel thin.

238
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,549
Sort of stretched...

239
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,049
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

240
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:19,749
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

241
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,149
And I don't expect I shall return.

242
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,650
In fact, I mean not to.

243
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,250
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

244
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,351
Gandalf, my old friend...

245
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:58,251
...this will be a night to remember.

246
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,252
Hello, hello.

247
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:26,452
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

248
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,052
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

249
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:36,152
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

250
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,152
Go on!

251
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:51,053
So there I was...

252
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:55,353
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

253
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,553
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

254
00:20:57,553 --> 00:21:00,053
...about how they were going to cook us.

255
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:05,253
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

256
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:09,854
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

257
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:13,654
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

258
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:17,154
...and turned them all to stone!

259
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:23,954
Quickly.

260
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,154
Up they go!

261
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:34,354
No no, the big one - big one

262
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:46,255
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

263
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,355
Are all these children yours?

264
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:51,455
Good gracious, you have been productive.

265
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:54,855
Bilbo?

266
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:58,255
Sackville-Bagginses!

267
00:21:58,555 --> 00:21:59,555
Quickly, hide!

268
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,656
Thank you, my boy.

269
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,456
You're a good lad, Frodo.

270
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:19,556
I'm very selfish, you know.

271
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:23,456
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

272
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:26,056
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

273
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:27,757
...but it wasn't out of charity.

274
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,757
I think it was because...

275
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:32,157
...of all my numerous relations...

276
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,957
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

277
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,157
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

278
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,057
No.

279
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,857
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

280
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,357
The point is, Frodo...

281
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:51,457
...you'll be all right.

282
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,858
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

283
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,658
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

284
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:00,358
This was your idea.

285
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,759
Bilbo.

286
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,559
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

287
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,159
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

288
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,159
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

289
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,960
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

290
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
I might've known.

291
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Speech, Bilbo!

292
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,460
Speech!

293
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,660
Speech!

294
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,161
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

295
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:12,061
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

296
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:14,761
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

297
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:16,061
...Hornblowers...

298
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,861
...Bolgers...

299
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,861
...Bracegirdles...

300
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,661
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

301
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:28,961
Today is my 111th birthday!

302
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,361
Happy birthday!

303
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:36,662
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

304
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:39,862
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

305
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:43,562
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

306
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:48,262
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

307
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,663
I have things to do.

308
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,163
I've put this off for far too long.

309
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:16,963
I regret to announce this is the end!

310
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,363
I'm going now.

311
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,363
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

312
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:26,964
Goodbye.

313
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:03,265
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

314
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,865
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

315
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,965
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

316
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:12,265
...and none of them should be used lightly.

317
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:14,465
It was just a bit of fun.

318
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:18,366
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

319
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:23,266
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

320
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,166
As often as I can spare them.

321
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,566
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

322
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:33,066
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

323
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:37,566
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

324
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:41,666
No. Wait, it's...

325
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,867
...here in my pocket.

326
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,667
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

327
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:59,867
Yet, after all, why not?

328
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:06,167
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

329
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,867
Is that so hard?

330
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:10,468
Well, no.

331
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,368
And yes.

332
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,368
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

333
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,468
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

334
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:25,768
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

335
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:27,968
It's mine.

336
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:31,868
My own.

337
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:36,069
- My precious.
- Precious?

338
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:39,169
It's been called that before, but not by you.

339
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:41,969
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

340
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,969
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

341
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,969
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

342
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:52,369
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

343
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,269
I am not trying to rob you.

344
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,070
I'm trying to help you.

345
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,770
All your long years, we've been friends.

346
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,370
Trust me as you once did.

347
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,070
Let it go.

348
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,570
You're right, Gandalf.

349
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,371
The ring must go to Frodo.

350
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:33,771
It's late. The road is long.

351
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:36,471
Yes, it is time.

352
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:44,071
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

353
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:21,973
I've thought up an ending for my book:

354
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:28,473
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

355
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:32,273
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

356
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,773
Goodbye, Gandalf.

357
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,073
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

358
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:52,074
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

359
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:57,174
Until our next meeting.

360
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:28,075
It's mine. My own.

361
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,775
My precious.

362
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,875
Riddles in the dark.

363
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,676
Bilbo!

364
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:38,276
Bilbo!

365
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,976
My precious.

366
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:48,676
Precious.

367
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:51,376
He's gone, hasn't he?

368
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:57,276
He talked for so long about leaving...

369
00:30:57,576 --> 00:31:00,176
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

370
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:06,677
Gandalf?

371
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,577
Bilbo's ring.

372
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:19,277
He's gone to stay with the elves.

373
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,477
He's left you Bag End.

374
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,778
Along with all his possessions.

375
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:31,778
The ring is yours now.

376
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,878
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

377
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:40,278
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

378
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:44,678
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

379
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,278
I don't understand.

380
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:52,679
Neither do I.

381
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:58,279
Keep it secret.

382
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,279
Keep it safe.

383
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,380
Shire!

384
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,798
Baggins!

385
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:49,541
{\an8} [Adûnaic] ♫ <i>Nêbâbîtham Magânanê.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ We renounce our Creator. ♫

386
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,182
"The year 3434 of the second age.

387
00:33:32,482 --> 00:33:36,683
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

388
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,683
...and the finding of the ring of power."

389
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,083
"It has come to me.

390
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:49,683
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

391
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:53,283
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

392
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:57,283
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

393
00:33:57,683 --> 00:34:00,083
It is precious to me...

394
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:03,584
...though I buy it with great pain.

395
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:10,784
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

396
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:15,784
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

397
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:20,084
A secret now that only fire can tell."

398
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:39,785
Shire...

399
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:41,885
...Baggins.

400
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:46,385
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

401
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:49,585
That way.

402
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:55,486
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

403
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:57,886
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

404
00:34:57,886 --> 00:35:00,386
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

405
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,486
<i>But there still be...</i>

406
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:04,086
<i>...many miles to go</i>

407
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,286
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

408
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:08,586
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

409
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:10,686
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

410
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:13,286
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

411
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,487
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

412
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:23,687
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

413
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:25,787
War is brewing.

414
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:29,187
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

415
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:32,187
Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is.

416
00:35:32,187 --> 00:35:36,787
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

417
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:39,787
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

418
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,587
And proud of it.

419
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:44,188
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

420
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:48,188
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

421
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:52,588
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

422
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,288
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

423
00:35:58,288 --> 00:36:02,888
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

424
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:05,488
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

425
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:10,089
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

426
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:12,389
Does she?

427
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,989
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

428
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,290
Is it secret? Is it safe?

429
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,290
What are you doing?

430
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,491
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

431
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,891
It's quite cool.

432
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,091
What can you see?

433
00:37:17,991 --> 00:37:20,291
Can you see anything?

434
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,491
Nothing.

435
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:26,992
There's nothing.

436
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,692
Wait.

437
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,992
There are markings.

438
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:40,892
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

439
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,592
There are few who can.

440
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:48,892
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

441
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:50,792
Mordor!

442
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:52,993
In the common tongue, it says:

443
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:56,693
"One ring to rule them all...

444
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:59,293
...One ring to find them...

445
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:01,693
...One ring to bring them all...

446
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:04,993
...and in the darkness bind them."

447
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,693
This is the One ring...

448
00:38:08,693 --> 00:38:13,993
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

449
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:18,294
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

450
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:21,694
Bilbo found it.

451
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,094
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

452
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:28,794
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

453
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:32,394
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

454
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:37,394
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

455
00:38:37,794 --> 00:38:40,094
The ring has awoken.

456
00:38:40,394 --> 00:38:42,994
It's heard its master's call.

457
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:46,995
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

458
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,895
No, Frodo.

459
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:59,195
The spirit of Sauron endured.

460
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:04,595
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

461
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,195
Sauron has returned.

462
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:10,196
His orcs have multiplied.

463
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:14,396
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

464
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:19,296
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

465
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:21,696
He is seeking it.

466
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:25,596
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

467
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:28,696
For the ring yearns above all else...

468
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:32,296
...to return to the hand of its master.

469
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:34,396
They are one...

470
00:39:34,396 --> 00:39:37,497
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

471
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:38,897
Frodo...

472
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:41,197
...he must never find it.

473
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:42,497
All right.

474
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:47,097
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

475
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:49,997
No one knows it's here, do they?

476
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:56,897
Do they, Gandalf?

477
00:39:57,997 --> 00:40:01,298
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

478
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:05,498
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

479
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:07,898
But the enemy found him first.

480
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,198
I don't know how long they tortured him.

481
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:16,798
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

482
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:19,198
Shire!

483
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:20,998
Baggins!

484
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,098
Shire.

485
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,998
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

486
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:29,999
Who goes there?

487
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:32,999
Take it, Gandalf!

488
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:34,499
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

489
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,899
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

490
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,399
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

491
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,199
I dare not take it.

492
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,999
Not even to keep it safe.

493
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,199
Understand, Frodo...

494
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:54,400
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

495
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,400
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

496
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,100
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

497
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,600
No, it can't.

498
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,401
What must I do?

499
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,401
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

500
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:28,001
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

501
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,401
Bree.

502
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:32,301
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

503
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,001
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

504
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,901
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

505
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,101
I don't have any answers.

506
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:48,002
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

507
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:50,502
He'll know what to do.

508
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:53,902
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

509
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:56,702
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

510
00:41:57,402 --> 00:42:00,602
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

511
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:04,502
I can cut across country easily enough.

512
00:42:07,102 --> 00:42:08,402
My dear Frodo.

513
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:11,703
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

514
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,703
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

515
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:17,303
And yet, after a hundred years...

516
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:19,503
...they can still surprise you.

517
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:22,603
Get down.

518
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:38,104
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

519
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:39,904
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

520
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:42,804
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

521
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:45,504
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

522
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:48,604
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

523
00:42:48,604 --> 00:42:49,904
Nothing important.

524
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,904
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

525
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,604
...and something about the end of the world but...

526
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:59,304
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

527
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:01,805
No?

528
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:04,205
Perhaps not.

529
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:08,805
I've thought of a better use for you.

530
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,505
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

531
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:17,305
Be careful, both of you.

532
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,305
The enemy has many spies in his service:

533
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:23,405
Birds, beasts.

534
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:27,106
Is it safe?

535
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,106
Never put it on...

536
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:33,706
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

537
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:35,406
Always remember, Frodo...

538
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:39,006
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

539
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:41,606
It wants to be found.

540
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,308
This is it.

541
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,808
This is what?

542
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,208
If I take one more step...

543
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:33,508
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

544
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,408
Come on, Sam.

545
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:49,709
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

546
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:53,909
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

547
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:58,509
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

548
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,809
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

Just shut your eyes...

00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,112
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

568
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:27,113
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

569
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:31,813
Me neither, Sam.

570
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:03,414
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

571
00:47:03,714 --> 00:47:05,314
The hour grows late.

572
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:08,914
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

573
00:47:09,414 --> 00:47:11,714
...seeking my counsel.

574
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:15,814
For that is why you have come, is it not?

575
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:17,314
My old friend.

576
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:19,215
Saruman.

577
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:27,015
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

578
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:30,115
So the ring of power has been found.

579
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,415
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

580
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:36,915
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

581
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:41,815
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

582
00:47:42,715 --> 00:47:46,716
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

583
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,516
Time?

584
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,116
What time do you think we have?

585
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:56,316
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

586
00:47:56,716 --> 00:47:58,816
He cannot yet take physical form...

587
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:01,716
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

588
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:07,316
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

589
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:13,817
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

590
00:48:15,617 --> 00:48:18,617
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

591
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:24,617
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

592
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:27,517
The eye of Sauron.

593
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:30,317
He is gathering all evil to him.

594
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:32,517
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

595
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:35,618
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

596
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:38,318
You know this?

597
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:40,418
How?

598
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,618
I have seen it.

599
00:48:43,118 --> 00:48:46,218
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

600
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:48,518
Why?

601
00:48:49,018 --> 00:48:51,618
Why should we fear to use it?

602
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:58,218
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

603
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,619
We do not know who else may be watching.

604
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,019
The hour is later than you think.

605
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,519
Sauron's forces are already moving.

606
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,519
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

607
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:15,919
The Nine?

608
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:19,019
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

609
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:22,019
...disguised as riders in black.

610
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,119
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

611
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,020
And kill the one who carries it.

612
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,920
Frodo!

613
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,920
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

614
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,521
There are none who can.

615
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,721
Against the power of Mordor...

616
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,621
...there can be no victory.

617
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:05,721
We must join with him, Gandalf.

618
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:09,321
We must join with Sauron.

619
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:14,621
It would be wise, my friend.

620
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:16,721
Tell me...

621
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,422
...friend...

622
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:23,322
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

623
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:04,623
I gave you the chance of...

624
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:08,423
...aiding me willingly...

625
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:12,724
...but you have elected the way of pain!

626
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:37,625
Mr. Frodo?

627
00:51:38,325 --> 00:51:40,025
Frodo? Frodo!

628
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:44,625
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

629
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:47,725
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

630
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:52,425
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

631
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:56,425
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

632
00:51:59,425 --> 00:52:00,425
Frodo.

633
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:02,926
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

634
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:04,526
Get off him.

635
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:06,526
Come on, Frodo.

636
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:08,526
What's the meaning of this?

637
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:12,026
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

638
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:15,426
You get back here!

639
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:17,726
Get out of my field!

640
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:20,626
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

641
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:23,826
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

642
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:25,226
And some cabbages.

643
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,327
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

644
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:32,427
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

645
00:52:32,827 --> 00:52:34,927
...he's clearly overreacting.

646
00:52:35,227 --> 00:52:36,627
Run!

647
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,628
Oh, that was close.

648
00:52:53,828 --> 00:52:56,828
I think I've broken something.

649
00:52:57,928 --> 00:53:00,228
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

650
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:03,928
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

651
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:06,528
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

652
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:16,728
That's mine.

653
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,129
That's nice, Merry.

654
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:23,729
Here's a nice one, Sam.

655
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:26,329
I think we should get off the road.

656
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:37,029
Get off the road!

657
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:38,629
Quick!

658
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,830
Be quiet!

659
00:54:59,232 --> 00:55:01,333
What was that?

660
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:35,534
Anything?

661
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,734
Nothing.

662
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:40,734
What is going on?

663
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:44,934
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

664
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:47,834
Frodo?

665
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,634
Get down!

666
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:08,735
I have to leave the Shire.

667
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:12,135
Sam and I must get to Bree.

668
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,735
Right.

669
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:17,335
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

670
00:56:25,736 --> 00:56:26,936
Run!

671
00:56:28,236 --> 00:56:30,136
This way! Follow me!

672
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:34,836
Run!

673
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:49,837
Get the rope, Sam!

674
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:54,037
Frodo!

675
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:56,137
Run, Frodo!

676
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:57,637
Go!
- Hurry!

677
00:56:57,637 --> 00:57:00,337
Frodo, come on!

678
00:57:01,437 --> 00:57:03,437
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

679
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:22,438
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

680
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,739
Come on.

681
00:57:49,939 --> 00:57:53,239
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

682
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:59,639
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

683
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,640
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

684
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,340
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

685
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,940
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

686
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,640
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

687
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,840
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

688
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,140
Can't be too careful.

689
00:58:38,941 --> 00:58:42,241
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

690
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,942
Excuse me.

691
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:11,742
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

692
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:17,842
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

693
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:22,843
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

694
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,043
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

695
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:29,843
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

696
00:59:30,143 --> 00:59:33,143
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

697
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:35,343
Gandalf.

698
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:37,843
Oh, yes...

699
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:40,143
...I remember. Elderly chap.

700
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,443
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

701
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:45,644
Not seen him for six months.

702
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:53,844
What do we do now?

703
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:02,244
Sam...

704
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:04,244
...he'll be here. He'll come.

705
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:09,144
Get out of my way!

706
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:13,245
What's that?

707
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:15,845
This, my friend, is a pint.

708
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,745
It comes in pints?

709
01:00:18,145 --> 01:00:21,645
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

710
01:00:28,145 --> 01:00:31,845
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

711
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,046
Excuse me.

712
01:00:38,946 --> 01:00:41,746
That man in the corner. Who is he?

713
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:47,346
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

714
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:52,046
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

715
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:55,746
Strider.

716
01:01:08,847 --> 01:01:11,947
<i>Baggins...</i>

717
01:01:15,147 --> 01:01:18,047
<i>Baggins...</i>

718
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:24,747
<i>Baggins...</i>

719
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:28,448
<i>Baggins...</i>

720
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:32,048
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

721
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:35,348
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

722
01:01:35,348 --> 01:01:38,648
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

723
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:40,948
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

724
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:47,248
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

725
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,250
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

726
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,250
<i>I see you.</i>

727
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,750
<i>There is no life...</i>

728
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,050
<i>...in the void.</i>

729
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,750
<i>Only...</i>

730
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,250
<i>...death.</i>

731
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:46,951
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

732
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,751
What do you want?

733
01:02:53,051 --> 01:02:55,051
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

734
01:02:55,551 --> 01:02:58,451
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

735
01:02:58,851 --> 01:03:01,251
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

736
01:03:01,551 --> 01:03:05,051
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

737
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:08,251
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

738
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,552
Yes.

739
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:14,552
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

740
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:21,052
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

741
01:03:22,952 --> 01:03:26,852
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

742
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:30,052
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

743
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:31,352
They're coming.

Great kings of men.

751
01:05:03,756 --> 01:05:06,756
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

752
01:05:07,556 --> 01:05:10,556
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

753
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:14,056
One by one, falling into darkness.

754
01:05:14,356 --> 01:05:16,756
Now they are slaves to his will.

755
01:05:19,257 --> 01:05:20,857
They are the Nazgûl.

756

Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

757

759

They will never stop hunting you.

760
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,658
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

761
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:57,858
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

762
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:01,058
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

763
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,258
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

764
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:08,758
We have no choice but to trust him.

765
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:12,259
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

766
01:06:14,759 --> 01:06:17,959
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

767
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:21,359
We're going to see the elves.

- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

769

- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

770

What about second breakfast?

771
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,960
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

772
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,461
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

773

- I wouldn't count on it.

Frodo.

850
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,890

- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

898
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:38,502
And you're lucky to be here too.

899
01:24:39,202 --> 01:24:43,102

have been beyond our aid.

01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:47,402
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

901
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:57,602
What happened, Gandalf?

902
01:24:58,602 --> 01:25:03,903
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

903
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,403
I was delayed.

904
01:25:11,503 --> 01:25:15,503
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

905
01:25:19,803 --> 01:25:24,303
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

906
01:25:24,803 --> 01:25:27,404
Embrace the power of the ring...

907
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:30,504
...or embrace your own destruction!

908
01:25:32,904 --> 01:25:36,604
There is only one lord of the ring.

909
01:25:37,104 --> 01:25:40,904
Only one who can bend it to his will.

910
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:45,704
And he does not share power.

911
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:03,305
So you have chosen...death.

912
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:17,205
Gandalf? What is it?

913
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,106
Nothing, Frodo.

914
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:22,706
Frodo!

915
01:26:24,106 --> 01:26:26,306
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

916
01:26:26,706 --> 01:26:29,306
Sam has hardly left your side.

917
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:31,706
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

918
01:26:32,306 --> 01:26:37,206
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

919
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:42,306
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

920
01:27:30,508 --> 01:27:33,608
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

921
01:27:34,008 --> 01:27:35,709
Bilbo.

922
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:42,609
There and back again

923
01:27:42,609 --> 01:27:45,309
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

924
01:27:48,509 --> 01:27:51,909
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

925
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:56,009
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

926
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,809
...visit Lake-town...

927
01:27:59,109 --> 01:28:02,410
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

928
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:07,710
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

929
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:21,810
I miss the Shire.

930
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:27,211
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

931
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:31,111
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

932
01:28:34,111 --> 01:28:37,611
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

933
01:28:43,111 --> 01:28:46,111
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

934
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:49,611
My dear boy.

935
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:57,612
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

936
01:28:58,512 --> 01:29:00,212
No harm in being prepared.

937
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:03,012
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

938
01:29:03,312 --> 01:29:06,012
- More than anything.
- I did.

939
01:29:06,412 --> 01:29:08,312
It's just....

940
01:29:09,112 --> 01:29:11,612
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

941
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:15,412
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

942
01:29:15,912 --> 01:29:19,013
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

943
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:20,913
Off home.

944
01:29:25,113 --> 01:29:27,013
You are right, Sam.

945
01:29:29,313 --> 01:29:32,013
We did what we set out to do.

946
01:29:32,613 --> 01:29:35,113
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

947
01:29:39,313 --> 01:29:41,613
I am ready to go home.

948
01:29:42,413 --> 01:29:44,314
His strength returns.

949
01:29:44,614 --> 01:29:50,114
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

950
01:29:51,014 --> 01:29:53,414
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

951
01:29:53,414 --> 01:29:57,214
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

952
01:29:57,614 --> 01:30:00,914
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

953
01:30:01,214 --> 01:30:06,414
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

954
01:30:06,814 --> 01:30:11,315
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

955
01:30:11,715 --> 01:30:14,315
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

956
01:30:14,715 --> 01:30:17,815
Our list of allies grows thin.

957
01:30:18,615 --> 01:30:21,315
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

958
01:30:21,615 --> 01:30:25,115
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

959
01:30:25,515 --> 01:30:27,815
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

960
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:32,615
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

961
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:35,316
Saruman is coming for the ring.

962
01:30:35,816 --> 01:30:39,716
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

963
01:30:40,116 --> 01:30:44,316
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

964
01:30:48,316 --> 01:30:49,316
Gandalf...

965
01:30:50,716 --> 01:30:53,116
...the ring cannot stay here.

966
01:31:12,817 --> 01:31:15,917
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

967
01:31:16,217 --> 01:31:18,917
They must decide now how to end it.

968
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:23,417
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

969
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:27,718
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

970
01:31:28,118 --> 01:31:33,018
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

971
01:31:34,718 --> 01:31:37,518
It is in men that we must place our hope.

972
01:31:38,018 --> 01:31:39,618
Men?

973
01:31:40,618 --> 01:31:43,618
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

974
01:31:44,018 --> 01:31:48,218
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

975
01:31:48,718 --> 01:31:52,118
It is because of men the ring survives.

976
01:31:52,519 --> 01:31:54,019
I was there, Gandalf.

977
01:31:54,819 --> 01:31:57,519
I was there 3000 years ago...

978
01:32:04,419 --> 01:32:06,719
... when Isildur took the ring.

979
01:32:07,019 --> 01:32:10,719
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

980
01:32:13,419 --> 01:32:15,919
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

981
01:32:17,619 --> 01:32:21,120
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

982
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,920
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

983
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,620
Cast it into the fire!

984
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:36,520
- Destroy it!
- No.

985
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,120
Isildur!

986
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:45,221
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

987
01:32:49,521 --> 01:32:53,621
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

988
01:32:54,621 --> 01:32:58,221
There's no strength left in the world of men.

989
01:32:58,621 --> 01:33:03,221
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

990
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:06,821
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

991
01:33:08,721 --> 01:33:12,322
He turned from that path a long time ago.

992
01:33:12,622 --> 01:33:14,722
He has chosen exile.

993
01:33:45,823 --> 01:33:47,723
You are no elf.

994
01:33:48,023 --> 01:33:50,023
Men of the South are welcome here.

995
01:33:50,723 --> 01:33:54,123
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

996
01:33:55,723 --> 01:33:58,423
Then we are here on common purpose...

997
01:33:58,823 --> 01:34:00,223
...friend.

998
01:34:15,624 --> 01:34:18,424
The shards of Narsil.

999
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:26,224
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

1000
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:31,525
It's still sharp.

1001
01:34:40,525 --> 01:34:43,425
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1002
01:35:10,426 --> 01:35:13,426
Why do you fear the past?

1003
01:35:14,326 --> 01:35:19,427
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

1004
01:35:19,927 --> 01:35:23,227
You are not bound to his fate.

1005
01:35:23,827 --> 01:35:27,627
The same blood flows in my veins.

1006
01:35:30,827 --> 01:35:33,327
The same weakness.

1007
01:35:36,127 --> 01:35:38,827
Your time will come.

1008
01:35:39,127 --> 01:35:43,327
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

1009
01:35:46,188 --> 01:35:48,898
[Sindarin] <i>A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn.</i>
[English] The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn.

1010
01:35:49,888 --> 01:35:53,478
[Sindarin] <i>Ú or le a ú or nin.</i>
[English] Not over you, not over me.

1011
01:36:04,638 --> 01:36:07,878
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i lú i erui govannem?</i>
[English] Do you remember when we first met?

1012
01:36:11,369 --> 01:36:15,399
[Sindarin] <i>Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.</i>
[English] I thought I had strayed into a dream.

1013
01:36:16,299 --> 01:36:18,979
[Sindarin] <i>Gwenwin in enninath.</i>
[English] Long years have passed.

1014
01:36:20,019 --> 01:36:23,679
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.</i>
[English] You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

1015
01:36:25,519 --> 01:36:27,819
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i beth i pennen?</i>
[English] Do you remember what I told you?

1016
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:36,630
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

1017
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:43,530
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

1018
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,730
And to that I hold.

1019
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:50,430
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

1020
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,530
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

1021
01:37:03,431 --> 01:37:06,731
I choose a mortal life.

1022
01:37:08,231 --> 01:37:12,331
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

1023
01:37:15,731 --> 01:37:18,131
...like my heart.

1024
01:37:34,032 --> 01:37:37,632
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

1025
01:37:38,032 --> 01:37:41,732
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

1026
01:37:42,532 --> 01:37:47,232
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

1027
01:37:47,632 --> 01:37:51,032
You will unite, or you will fall.

1028
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:55,533
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

1029
01:37:57,533 --> 01:38:00,833
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

1030
01:38:15,133 --> 01:38:16,733
So it is true.

1031
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:28,034
<i>The ring of power...</i>

1032
01:38:30,134 --> 01:38:31,634
<i>The doom of men...</i>

1033
01:38:34,234 --> 01:38:36,234
In a dream...

1034
01:38:38,034 --> 01:38:41,134
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1035
01:38:41,434 --> 01:38:43,134
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

1036
01:38:43,935 --> 01:38:45,735
A voice was crying:

1037
01:38:46,035 --> 01:38:48,835
"Your doom is near at hand.

1038
01:38:50,035 --> 01:38:52,635
Isildur's bane is found."

1039
01:38:54,765 --> 01:38:56,165
(The Ring)
[Black Speech] <i>Sherkuk-ishi</i>
[English] In your blood

1040
01:38:56,635 --> 01:38:58,435
Isildur s bane.

1041
01:38:59,035 --> 01:38:59,335
Boromir!

1042
01:38:59,296 --> 01:39:03,065
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1043
01:39:00,645 --> 01:39:03,345
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu...</i>
{\an8} [English] Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...

1044
01:39:03,065 --> 01:39:06,775
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them...

1045
01:39:06,599 --> 01:39:10,862
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ombi kuzd-durbagu... shirku</i>
{\an8} [English] Seven for the Dwarf-lords... blood

1046
01:39:06,985 --> 01:39:10,156
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg thrakatulûk...</i>
[English] ...One ring to bring them all...

1047
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:14,642
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ash Burz-Durbagu burzum-ishi...</i>
{\an8} [English] One for the Dark lord on his dark throne...

1048
01:39:13,066 --> 01:39:17,386
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.</i>
[English] ...and in the darkness bind them.

1049
01:39:23,536 --> 01:39:27,236
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1050
01:39:27,636 --> 01:39:31,136
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

1051
01:39:31,436 --> 01:39:33,436
...for the black speech of Mordor...

1052
01:39:33,836 --> 01:39:35,136
...may yet be heard...

1053
01:39:35,437 --> 01:39:38,237
...in every corner of the West!

1054
01:39:38,537 --> 01:39:41,137
The ring is altogether evil.

1055
01:39:41,637 --> 01:39:43,037
It is a gift.

1056
01:39:43,837 --> 01:39:45,737
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1057
01:39:46,437 --> 01:39:48,437
Why not use this ring?

1058
01:39:48,737 --> 01:39:51,437
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

1059
01:39:51,737 --> 01:39:55,837
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1060
01:39:56,337 --> 01:39:58,437
...are your lands kept safe.

1061
01:40:00,237 --> 01:40:04,438
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1062
01:40:04,838 --> 01:40:08,438
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1063
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:13,138
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1064
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:16,938
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1065
01:40:17,238 --> 01:40:19,138
This is no mere ranger.

1066
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:23,738
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1067
01:40:24,438 --> 01:40:27,239
You owe him your allegiance.

1068
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:33,339
Aragorn.

1069
01:40:35,139 --> 01:40:37,939
This is Isildur s heir?

1070
01:40:40,339 --> 01:40:43,039
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1071
01:40:44,519 --> 01:40:46,419
[Sindarin] <i>Havo dad, Legolas.</i>
[English] Sit down, Legolas.

1072
01:40:49,939 --> 01:40:52,740
Gondor has no king.

1073
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,340
Gondor needs no king.

1074
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,540
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1075
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,040
You have only one choice.

1076
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,640
The ring must be destroyed.

1077
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:21,441
What are we waiting for?

1078
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:31,803
[Black Speech] <i>Daghburz-ishi makha, ghurarmu shirku.</i>
[English] In the land of Mordor, a sacrifice of blood.

1079
01:41:33,641 --> 01:41:36,541
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1080
01:41:36,941 --> 01:41:41,041
...by any craft that we here possess.

1081
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:45,642
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1082
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:49,742
Only there can it be unmade.

1083
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:53,442
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1084
01:41:53,742 --> 01:41:58,042
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1085
01:41:57,447 --> 01:42:00,482
[Black Speech] <i>Makha gulshu darulu.</i>
[English] Where the Shadows lie.

1086
01:42:00,542 --> 01:42:02,642
One of you...

1087
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:05,342
...must do this.

1088
01:42:08,342 --> 01:42:11,943
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1089
01:42:12,943 --> 01:42:16,443
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1090
01:42:17,343 --> 01:42:21,343
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1091
01:42:21,743 --> 01:42:25,843
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1092
01:42:26,743 --> 01:42:28,643
It is a barren wasteland...

1093
01:42:29,043 --> 01:42:32,343
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1094
01:42:32,743 --> 01:42:36,544
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1095
01:42:36,844 --> 01:42:40,944
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1096
01:42:41,344 --> 01:42:45,644
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1097
01:42:46,044 --> 01:42:48,444
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1098
01:42:48,744 --> 01:42:53,244
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1099
01:42:53,644 --> 01:42:58,744
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1100
01:43:00,944 --> 01:43:03,345
Never trust an elf!

1101
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:10,245
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1102
01:43:10,745 --> 01:43:13,545
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1103
01:43:14,095 --> 01:43:16,875
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1104
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:19,385
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1105
01:43:19,395 --> 01:43:21,485
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1106
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:23,595
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1107
01:43:23,595 --> 01:43:25,585
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1108
01:43:25,595 --> 01:43:27,796
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1109
01:43:27,796 --> 01:43:29,696
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1110
01:43:32,346 --> 01:43:34,346
I will take it.

1111
01:43:36,646 --> 01:43:39,146
I will take it.

1112
01:43:44,946 --> 01:43:47,946
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1113
01:43:56,247 --> 01:43:57,347
Though...

1114
01:44:00,547 --> 01:44:02,347
...I do not know the way.

1115
01:44:04,347 --> 01:44:08,447
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1116
01:44:08,847 --> 01:44:12,147
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1117
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:16,347
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1118
01:44:17,147 --> 01:44:18,448
...I will.

1119
01:44:21,748 --> 01:44:23,948
You have my sword.

1120
01:44:25,848 --> 01:44:27,848
And you have my bow.

1121
01:44:28,548 --> 01:44:30,848
And my ax.

1122
01:44:38,048 --> 01:44:40,848
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1123
01:44:43,048 --> 01:44:46,549
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1124
01:44:47,249 --> 01:44:49,649
...then Gondor will see it done.

1125
01:44:52,249 --> 01:44:56,849
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1126
01:44:57,249 --> 01:45:01,949
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1127
01:45:02,649 --> 01:45:04,449
Oy. We're coming too!

1128
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:09,349
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1129
01:45:09,349 --> 01:45:12,750
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1130
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,450
...mission.

1131
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,000
Quest.

1132
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,500
Thing.

1133
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,000
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1134
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,500
Nine companions.

1135
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,100
So be it.

1136
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,500
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1137
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,000
Great!

1138
01:45:35,401 --> 01:45:37,501
Where are we going?
